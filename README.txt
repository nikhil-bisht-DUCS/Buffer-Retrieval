The program was made using C++ to simulate how a process retrieves a Buffer from the system's HashQueue/Freelist, as the case may be.

The freelist is first loaded with Buffers, then the actual process takes place where different processes attempt to retrieve Buffer for themselves.

Appropriate comments have been left in the source code for better understanding of the program flow. Device number and delayed Write have been excluded from the simulation code.
